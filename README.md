# CP1404 Assignment 2 - Song List 2.0 by YOUR_NAME

A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of songs to learn.

# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?

5 Days which is 30 Hours. 

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?

When I finish the assignment 2 and the program is working, I feel excited, the most satisfied, I think is I finish the work not at last moment. 

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?

I have a lot of Debug at the last step, when I was checking all my work. Most of the code that didn't work what I thought. 

## 4. What worked well in your development process?

I had learned CP1406 last semester, so I think when I was tried to do song list.kv I did pretty well.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?

Well, for the next project I could make the work more pretty. 

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.

I had use W3 school for the kv anf py file, I had forgot some of it. However, it had help me during the Debugging. 

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.

There are only two mean problems I have, first is the toggle button I can't turn the color button from "To lean" to "Learned" and when 
I add new song or any changes if I click other items it is back to before or disappear. I had change the main.py and songlist.kv. toggle_button and add_song. 

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.

Well, it is more convenient to connect the other programming.
